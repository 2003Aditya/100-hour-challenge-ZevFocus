# 🚀 100 Hours to a Golang Job

This is my personal challenge: I have **100 hours** to contribute to open-source Golang projects and land a job.
I’ll stream my journey, document everything here, and share my progress openly.

## ⏳ The Secret Weapon: ZevFocus

This journey is powered by **[ZevFocus](https://zevfocus.github.io/ZevFocus)** — a CLI I built that tracks **real deep work**, not just hours spent in front of a laptop.

Here’s why it’s different:
- 🔒 **Tamper-proof** — you can’t fake your work stats
- 🧠 **Active vs Idle** — it knows when I’m truly working vs. distracted
- 📊 **Transparent** — every session is logged and shared here
- 🚀 **Proof of consistency** — no vague “I coded a lot today,” only real, verifiable data

So when I say I put in **100 hours**, you’ll see the *actual proof*.
Most people *talk* about discipline — I’m literally logging mine in public.

👉 Every log in this repo is tracked by ZevFocus.
If you’re following along, you’ll see **exactly how much focused effort it takes to break into a Golang job in weeks.**

*(Fair warning: once you see this kind of visibility, it’s hard to go back to “just guessing” your productivity.)*
